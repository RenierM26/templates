Seems to be identical to [LED Starry Sky Projector Light](https://templates.blakadder.com/led_star_projector.html) in every way except that the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) has been replaced with a WB3S.

Transplanting an ESP-12 is confirmed to work using the original template (pinouts are the same), but cheap solder makes it slightly difficult to remove without damaging the contacts.
