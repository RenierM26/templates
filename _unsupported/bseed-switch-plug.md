The Plugs may be convertable, though Tuya-Convert failed, they are based on a Tywe2s layout, the cases can be opened without damage, but difficult with 2 Hands. 

The Switch however is based on a WR4 module which is not using a ESP8266. The WR4 module may be exchanged with an ESP12 module or similar, since it is on a riser board, but that would be some effort. It seems that the connections are Tywe2s retrofit.
