Requires tasmota-display.bin to support

```console
DisplayAddress 0x3C
DisplayDimmer 100
DisplayModel 2
DisplayWidth 64
DisplayHeight 48
```

Since the display is very small, I recommend to use Font 0. There are 10.5 columns, so if you set 11 columns, the last character is truncated although readable.

```console
DisplayFont 0
DisplayRows 6
DisplayCols 11
```
