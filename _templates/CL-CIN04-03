It's a generic WiFi controller, at the time of this writing it's sold by "ALANTOP" for $6 on Amazon. It says it takes 12-24V at 240W. The device's casing says 5A per channel.
The casing has a spot and a terminal for a 4th channel, but it is missing the MOSFET on the board. I'm unsure if adding a MOSFET will enable it.

For flashing follow this page on Tasmota: <https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/TYWE3S/>.

There is only one IC on this chip, which the three GPIO pins go through before reaching the color channel outputs on the board.
The chip in question just for reference: <https://www.nexperia.com/products/analog-logic-ics/asynchronous-interface-logic/buffers-inverters-drivers/HEF4050BT.html>
