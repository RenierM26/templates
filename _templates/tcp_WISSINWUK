There appears to be a newer version of these devices on the market. I recently bought two single plugs and a four pack.
All the plugs have the same model number and appear identical, but the ones from the four pack have upgraded firmware and
couldn't be used with tuya-convert. I manually reflashed them with a serial cable (not at all an easy procedure with these
plugs due to their board layout) and installed Tasmota.

While the configuration for the single plugs with the older firmware is as listed above, the plugs from the four pack have
different pin allocations. The LED is on GPIO5, relay GPIO12 and button GPIO13.
