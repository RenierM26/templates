Update 2021/02/16 Tuya-convert OTA failed for this plug due to new Tuya firmware (PSK identity 02).

This plug contains a [TYWE2S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe2s) module which was simple enough to solder pins.

Note the plug casing itself uses the extremely uncommon tri-groove tamperproof screws which make disassembly challenging.  The BrilliantSmart 20676/05 plug is a cost-competitive alternative with the same TYWE2S module and phillips head screws.
