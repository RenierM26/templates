Bulb is using two chips to control LEDs by PWM:
- for white LEDs is SM2083EGL - GPIO 5
- for RGB LEDs is SM15133EK - GPIO 12, GPIO 15, GPIO 14

If you want have white color with white LEDs (than mix of RGB LEDs), then in console you need to set: SetOption105 1
new format Template (Tasmota 9.5+) with command:
```json
{"NAME":"Lanberg E27 9W RGBW","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,1,419,0,0,416,0,418,417,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18,"CMND":"so105 1"}
```
