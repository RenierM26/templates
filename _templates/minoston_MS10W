# Warning
As of August 2021 this device comes with a Tuya WB3S module which cannot be flashed with Tasmota.
```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 21,3;
```
```console
DimmerRange 25,255
```
In some cases, when the ```Power OFF``` toggle isn't working correctly, a rule can be added to fix the problem.
```Rule1 ON power1#state=0 DO Backlog Power OFF; Dimmer 0 ENDON```
