## Flashing

Tuya-Convert was the more convenient option for installing Tasmota but it is possible to flash over serial.

When flashing using Tuya-Convert press and hold 45°C button for 5 seconds to enter fast flashing mode and follow the normal tuya-convert procedure.

When flashing via serial connection remember to pull the MCU Reset Pin to ground. It's a HR7P169BFGSF from Easysoft so pin 4 must be connected to ground.

## Functions

MCU Product ID: {"p":"h6MjwrnldNTu4kX3","v":"1.0.0","m":1}

- `dpID 101` controls kettle modes (corresponds to device buttons)

  - `0` - heat to 45°C then maintain temperature for 2 hours
  - `1` - heat to 60°C then maintain temperature for 2 hours
  - `2` - heat to 85°C then maintain temperature for 2 hours
  - `3` - heat to 100°C then maintain temperature for 3 minutes
  - `4` - heat to 100°C (power button flashing when active)
  - `5` - heat to preset temperature (70°C by default, can be changed using `dpID 102`) then maintain temperature for 2 hours (keep warm button)
  - `6` - reset any running program and enter standby mode (pulsating power button)
- `dpID 102` sets water temperature for mode `5` (keep warm button), recommended 35 - 100 range
- `dpID 104` error notification:
  - `0x00` - no error
  - `0x01` - kettle empty
  - `0x04` - kettle overheated due to low water
- `dpID 105` reports current water temperature
- `dpID 106` reports kettle status:
  - `1` - kettle removed from base
  - `2` - standby mode
  - `3` - heating to programmed target temperature
  - `4` - cooling down to programmed target temperature
  - `5` - maintaining programmed target temperature
- `dpID 107` reports approximate time until programmed target temperature is reached or remaining time for maintaining programmed target temperature when in mode `5`. Cannot be changed!
- `dpID 108` is still unknown, it is always reporting `5` and doesn't respond to any of the TuyaSend commands.

## Configuration

After applying the template and configuring Wi-Fi and MQTT the preconfigured relay will not control anything.

Basic configuration option could be this:

```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 99,1; TuyaMCU 81,107; TuyaMCU 71,105; TuyaMCU 72,102; TuyaMCU 61,101; TuyaMCU 62,106; TuyaEnumList 1,6; TuyaEnumList 2,5; TempRes 0
```

For controlling the kettle modes you'll have to use `TuyaSend4` command:

| dpID | Function           | Command | Additional Comments |
| ---- |-------------       | -------  | ---------- |
| 101  | Operation mode     | `TuyaEnum 1,<x>`  | `<x>` being the mode `0..6`
| 102  | Target temperature | `TuyaSend2 102,<x>`        | `<x>` being the temperature in C
| 105  | Current temperature|      | reported in the GUI and as `{"TuyaSNS":{"Temperature":xx}}`
| 106  | Working status      |      | reported at `{"TuyaEnum2":x}`
| 107  | Time remaining    |   | reported in the GUI and as `{"TuyaSNS":{"Timer1":x}}`


## Control Examples

If you don't have an external solution for easy control you can map back one or more dummy relays (f.e. `TuyaMCU 11,108`) for controlling kettle modes and link them with TuyaSend using rules. *States will not be in sync if controlled with other means. Set `PowerOnState 0` to avoid weirdness on device reset.*

Use dummy Relay 1 to activate 85°C mode.

```console
Rule ON Power1#State=1 DO TuyaSend4 101,2 ENDON ON Power1#State=0 DO TuyaSend4 101,6 ENDON
```

Put kettle in standby mode when keep warm timer reaches 110 seconds aka keep warm function lasts only 10 minutes instead of 2 hours.

```console
Rule ON TuyaReceived#DpType2Id107=110 DO TuyaSend4 101,6 ENDON
```

I'm using this rule because I mostly heat water to custom temperatures with mode 5 and I don't need the kettle to keep heating the water for the next 2 hours.

Override device button action and `TuyaSend4 101,<x>` command. *Has a minor side effect of multiple beeps.*
Example overrides 45°C (`mode 0`) and instead controls another Tasmota light.

```console
Rule ON TuyaReceived#DpType4Id101=0 DO Backlog TuyaSend4 101,6; Publish cmnd/kitchen_light/POWER toggle ENDON 
```

`TuyaMCU 11,108` sets the relay to `dpID 108` which avoids superfluous MCU messages that are sent when issuing a command to a nonexistent dpID.
