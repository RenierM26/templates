## Functions
* dpid1 Power relay - When toggled will turn fan on / off.
* dpid2 Sets the Mode: 0 = Normal, 1 = Natural, 2 = Sleep
    * Normal (Manual) Mode: Fan speed is set by dpid3
    * Natural Mode: The fan speed varies randomly between (speed 1 to 4) giving the effect of a natural breeze.
    * Sleep Mode: The fan will start at the last speed it was set to and then slowly going down to low reserving power.
* dpid3 Sets the fan speed 1 slow - 4 fast, (remote display 1 - 4)
* dpid5 Oscillate relay - When toggled will turn oscillation on / off.
* dpid21 Temperature sensor. 
* dpid22 Unknown at this point.
* dpid23 Countdown timer in minutes (When timer function is set) 
* dpid24 Unknown at this point.
* dpid101 Sets the timer function 1 = 1 hour, 2 = 2 hours, 3 = 3 hours â€¦.. 12 = 12 hours and 0 = Off

## Configuration
Configure Tasmota DpIds with the correct FnIds:
```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 61,2; TuyaMCU 62,3; TuyaMCU 12,5; TuyaMCU 71,21; TuyaMCU 98,23; TuyaMCU 64,101;
```
Configure the correct Enums lists for Speed, Mode and Timer:
```console
Backlog TuyaEnumlist 1,3; TuyaEnumlist 2,4; TuyaEnumlist 4,13;
```
Setting required for the Temperature sensor to display correctly:
```console
TempRes 0
```

Setting required to publish results to MQTT:
```console
SetOption66 1
```

Rules used to publish Speed, Mode, Timeleft (Countdown in minutes) and Timer:
```console
Backlog Rule1 ON tuyareceived#dptype2id3 DO publish stat/%topic%/SPEED %value% ENDON ON tuyareceived#dptype4id2 DO publish stat/%topic%/MODE %value% ENDON ON tuyareceived#dptype2Id23 DO publish stat/%topic%/TIMELEFT %value% ENDON ON tuyareceived#DpType4Id101 DO publish stat/%topic%/TIMER %value% ENDON; Rule1 1
```

```console
Backlog Rule2 ON System#Boot DO Event resync ON Event#resync DO Backlog Power1; Power2; TuyaSend0; ENDON; Rule2 1
```

## Home Assistant
