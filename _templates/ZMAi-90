Full instructions [here](https://www.creationfactory.co/2019/12/reverse-engineering-zmai-90-din-rail.html)

There is a more recent version of the device which uses TuyaMCU protocol for communications instead of its custom serial protocol.  To configure this version, don't use this template but use "Tuya MCU (54)" module (`command `module 54`) and the following settings entered via the console.  

```console
Backlog SetOption66 1; TuyaMCU 0,17; TuyaMCU 32,18; TuyaMCU 31,19; TuyaMCU 33,20; SetOption59 1
```
```console
Backlog Rule1 1; Rule1 on System#Boot do RuleTimer1 5 endon on Rules#Timer=1 do backlog SerialSend5 55aa0001000000; RuleTimer1 5 endon
```

There is even newer version of ZMAI-90 with WB3S module. It turns out its pin to pin compatible with ESP12E, so replacing the WB3S module with ESP12E flashed with tasmota will gives tasmota compatibility.

However this one even use different TuyaMCU protocol and to configure this verson you need to put:
```console
Backlog SetOption66 1; TuyaMCU 11,16; TuyaMCU 36,6; TuyaMCU 37,1; SetOption59 1; SetOption72 1
```
```console
Rule1 on System#Boot do RuleTimer1 10 endon on Rules#Timer=1 do backlog TuyaSend8; RuleTimer1 10 endon
```
