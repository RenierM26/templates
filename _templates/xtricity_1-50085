Uses Tuya TYWE3L module. Do not link these Bulb with Tuya's official app before flashing. it would update firmware and prevent flashing using Tuya-convert-2.3 .  Opening the device will likely break the outer shell, meaning you will not be able to re-assemble it.   Here's a link for the PCB pinout : https://images.tuyacn.com/smart_res/sample_module/tywe3l_pic2.png
