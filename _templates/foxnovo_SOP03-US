Pry out rubber screw covers and use a small Y2 or flat head screwdriver to remove security screws. Remove the PCB by removing 4 more security screws (2 holding the plug, and two on either side of the board). Solder temporary wires to the TYWE2S microcontroller board on GND, VCC, TX, RX, and a jumper cable between ground and IO0 (GPIO0).
