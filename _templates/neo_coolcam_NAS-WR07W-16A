Version 16A, 3680W, AC 85-230V, 50/60Hz, PCB label NAS-OGCZ-16A-T, with power measurement using BL0937, gray socket label, without rainbow as on some photos!
More [PCB photos](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/666#issuecomment-683071700).

Warning! To connect all flash wires, it is necessary to physically destroy the socket or use sharp spring needle pins directly from the side of the Wi-Fi antenna.

(?) Old info: The circuit board says NAS-WR01W. The template for the NAS-WR01W 10A doesn't work on this!
