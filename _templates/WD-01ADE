Dual-pump home plant irrigation system. Runs using included power plug, via USB or four AAA batteries. Each pump can be triggered independently.

While flashing the ESP can be powered via serial, but it will not boot normally. Disconnect VCC from the serial-to-USB adapter and use the included power cable instead to power the device.

### Flashing

1. Use a dull blade or thin plastic piece to move the front cover aside so that you can unscrew the two hidden screws. While removing the front cover some plastic tabs may break on the sides.

3. Unscrew the board and solder some jumper wires to the [PSF-B04](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#psf-b85psf-b01psf-b04) chip.
