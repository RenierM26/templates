Will require the standard Tasmota shutter support and calibration.

Added some rules to get the switch working, based on https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Blinds-and-Shutters and copied from another curtain switch page below.

```haskell
SetOption80 1 # Enable shutter support, reset the device after for correct interface to show up

ShutterRelay1 1 # Enable shutter relay 1

Backlog PulseTime1 0; PulseTime2 0 # ShutterMode0

Pulsetime3 1 # auto disable Power3 button

Backlog Interlock 1,2,3; Interlock ON

PowerRetain 1 # Save state for Home Assistant

Rule1 on Power3#State=1 do ShutterStop1 endon # Use the middle button for stopping shutter movement

Rule1 1

Rule2 on Power1#State=0 do LEDPower1 0 endon on Power1#State=1 do LEDPower1 1 endon on Power2#State=0 do LEDPower2 0 endon on Power2#State=1 do LEDPower2 1 endon on Power3#State=0 do LEDPower3 0 endon on Power3#State=1 do LEDPower3 1 endon # Giving color on button press

Rule2 1

WebButton3 â–  # Set stop symbol for the third button in the web GUI

SwitchMode1 4 # Make the buttons do their actions on touch, not release

SwitchMode2 4

SwitchMode3 4
