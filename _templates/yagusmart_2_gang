While it's marked as DS-101 on the back, the other DS-101 templates didn't work, so I created this one instead.

Connections:

| Serial | Board |
|--------|-------|
| 3.3V   | VCC   |
| GND    | GND   |
| GND    | GPIO0 |
| RX     | TXD0  |
| TX     | RXD0  |

As shown in the image, resistor R49 will need to be removed, as it interferes with the flashing process. It's just a 0 ohm resistor, so if it's too small for you to reliably resolder, just use a small blob of solder to bridge the pads.
