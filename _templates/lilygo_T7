The board uses an older version of ESP32 chip that requires a binary wih the PSRAM fix compiled in. 

Compile with platformio env including these flags:

```
-DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM 
-DHAS_PSRAM_FIX 
-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue 
-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-strategy=memw
```

Template maps the JST SH1.0 4 pin connector GPIO21 and GPIO22 to I2C.

## Note: The difference between T7 V1.4 and V1.5:

GPIO16 and GPIO17 are replaced with GPIO25 and GPIO27. Board remains compatible with D1 mini expansion boards.
