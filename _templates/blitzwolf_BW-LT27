This light bulb has a built-in IR receiver connected to a GPIO which opens up many possibilities.  You could theoretically use your TVs remote to control the bulb.

With the following rules the remote is configured with these functions:

1. Power TOGGLE
2. Nighlight mode using Dimmer 10 and CT 500
3. Dimmer + / -
4. CT +/- (CCT mode) / Color +/- (RGB mode) 
5. Max brightness - Dimmer 100
6. Switch between CCT and RGB mode
7. Maximum white (Color FFFFFFFFFF) (CCT mode) / Single color (RGB mode) 
8. Wakeup mode (CCT mode) / Cycle RGB colors (RGB mode) 

```console
Rule1 
ON System#Boot DO Backlog Rule1 1, Rule2 1, Rule3 0 ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C754AB DO Backlog Dimmer 10; CT 500 ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C724DB DO Power toggle ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7649B DO Backlog Rule2 2; Rule3 2 ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C704FB DO Dimmer 100 ENDON
```

```console
Rule2
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7847B DO Dimmer + ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C744BB DO Dimmer - ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7E41B DO CT + ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C714EB DO CT - ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7827D DO Color FFFFFFFFFF ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7C43B DO Backlog Dimmer 0; CT 300; Wakeup 100 ENDON
```

```console
Rule3
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7847B DO Dimmer + ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C744BB DO Dimmer - ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7E41B DO Color - ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C714EB DO Color + ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7827D DO Scheme 0 ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x21C7C43B DO Backlog Color 1; Scheme 4 ENDON
```

```console
Backlog Rule1 1, Rule2 1, Rule3 0, Fade on, WakeupDuration 60
```

Modify WakeupDuration to how many seconds you would like the wakeup sequence to last. Fade is for smoothness of transition (adjust the fading speed with `Speed +` or `Speed -`)
