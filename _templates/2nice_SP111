The 2NICE SP111 is looking quite identical to the Gosund SP111 types. The manufacturer mentioned on the package is 'Shenzhen Gosund Technologie Co. Ltd.'
Major difference is that the 2NICE SP111 device does not support power monitoring, but it supports the analog temperature sensor instead. 
So the template is based on the Gosund SP111 templates with GPIO5, GPIO12 and GPIO14 set to 'None' and with the FLAG set to 2"
