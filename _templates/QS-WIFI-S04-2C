Use the 'SwitchDebounce' command to set the number of pulses required for the switch to be recognized as on or off. For example: SwitchDebounce 69 will turn the switch on after three pulses and turn it off after three missing ones.

`SwitchDebounce 99` or `109` work like a charm in EU.

Despite being labelled 2x5A there are two 10A relays inside the device.
