This dev board can be powered only by AC 90V-250V. Do not flash while powered this way.

Flash with `tasmota32-nspanel.bin`, otherwise the relay on the board clicks on reboot because it's using a pin reserved for PSRAM.

### Flashing

***WARNING: DO NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OPERATE THE DEVICE WHILE CONNECTED TO AC POWER***

Flash using any of the provided TX/RX headers and GND. Supply 5V power from a stable source. Use the IO button to enter flash mode.    
I've flashed it by powering it via 3.3V pin using the "Golden CH340G" adapter.
