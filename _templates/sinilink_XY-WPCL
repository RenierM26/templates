It is possible to use solid core 24 AWG wires to make the connection without needing to solder them to the Sinilink board, but they may need soldering to a connector for the USB to serial adapter. Alternatively, you can strip some Ethernet Cat5e cable, which has the perfect diameter to fit in this board without soldering.

## Configuration
The Relay must we toggle from off-on-off not lock on on state, mine stayed on long time triggering the shutdown the computer again by long press 'power button', that why i added "Pulsetime 10" (it's my first time i don't known if i doing it right but works)

For check if is powered the Switch1/binary sensor is used since the button will go back to off, remember computer power on is a push button.

In my case, the usb powered version, that binary version is related/detected with the 'power led' signal and works but not turn on/off the power led of my computer box, i not fix that yet since i don't known how to fix, but it's a minor problem compared with current template that not work.

Switch1 is detached and is used to monitor power status of the PC. It will be discovered as a binary sensor in Home Assistant.

See [issue #1472](https://github.com/blakadder/templates/issues/1472) for Home Assistant YAML configuration
