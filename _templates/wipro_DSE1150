The original manufacturer code for the device is SM-SO306, which seems to be made by SHENZHEN XENON INDUSTRIAL LTD. These are usually Tuya software devices, sold under different brand names and logos in various parts of the world. I flashed Tasmota using Tuya convert (OTA) on a Wipro branded strip. Some devices I have identified to have similar properties are also listed below (all found in Amazon India website). 

Known in various names, such as SM-SO306-U2 / SM-SO306-UZ2, Xergy Smart Power Strip, Wipro Smart Extension (DSE1150 in India) or Nishica Smart Power Extension (SM-SO306-2A)
