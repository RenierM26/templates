A TuyaMCU based dimmer switch with power monitoring. 

As at May 2020, readily flash-able using tuya-convert. Best not to connect to the device in advance with a Tuya app to avoid flashing new firmware.

After configuring your WiFi details and configuring the template, use the console to issue the following commands :
```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 21,2; TuyaMCU 33,6; TuyaMCU 31,5; TuyaMCU 32,4; DimmerRange 1,24
```

If that doesn't work try following instructions at https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU/
