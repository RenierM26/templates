I was able to flash all filament light bulbs from LSC with the upgrade Tuya convert. Link to the process is http://www.thesmarthomehookup.com/tuya-convert-walk-through-february-2019. The only thing i changed is the github where i download tuya convert from located at https://github.com/M4dmartig4n/tuya-convert
