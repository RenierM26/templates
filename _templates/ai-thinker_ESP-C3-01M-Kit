This is a weird development board. Its form factor is one breadboard row wider than a standard D1 Mini. Five of the GPIO's are used by an RGB, a cool white and a warm white LED.

The template is configured with the cool white LED being LedLink and the warm white one as the power LED.

Board comes with headers soldered in as in the image making its difficult to use with a breadboard.
