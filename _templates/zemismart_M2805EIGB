Configuration is the same as [https://templates.blakadder.com/zemismart_M515EGB.html](https://templates.blakadder.com/zemismart_M515EGB.html)

Do not connect this device to the Tuya App as it will update it to the latest version and tasmota cannot be installed OTA.

## Serial Flashing 
Flashed via serial using broken out pins. Tuya Convert did not work due to new firmware.

[TYWE3S Pinout](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/TYWE3S/)

Flashing will not work unless you disconnect the ribbon cable connecting the second board.

GPIO0 must be connected to ground. I also had RST connected to ground, but flashing only started after disconnecting RST so it may not be necessary at all.

The device can be opened by running a sharp knife around the groove to break the glue seal, then the cover can be flipped out
