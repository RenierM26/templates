In order to add MODBUS functionality you will need to compile your own Tasmota build with USE_MODBUS_BRIDGE enabled (maybe USE_MODBUS_BRIDGE_TCP as well, depending on your needs) 

It is possible to use solid core 24 AWG wires to make the connection without needing to solder them to the Sinilink board, but they may need soldering to a connector for the USB to serial adapter. Alternatively, you can strip some Ethernet Cat5e cable, which has the perfect diameter to fit in this board without soldering.
