Appears to be identical to the Teckin SB50 v3. Tuya-Convert failed due to the firmware version being so recent. Serial flash was needed. Lid was very easy to remove without damage using a plastic spudger, and the upper PCB was popped out with the same. Only some forgiving "hot glue" type adhesive was used which made things easy.
