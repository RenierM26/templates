- Fan oscillation is an Enum on DpId 4. 
- Fan speed is an Enum on DpId 3 with values ranging from 0 to 7 inclusive. Add 1 to the DpId 3 value to get the speed that is reported on the front of the fan. 
- The operating modes are an Enum on DpId 2. The "normal" mode is value 0, "nature" mode is value 1, and "sleep" mode is value 2.
