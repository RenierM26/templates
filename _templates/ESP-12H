Read [my guide](https://blakadder.com/replace-tuya-esp12/) on replacing a compatible module.

![Pinout](/assets/device_images/ESP-12H_pinout.webp)

Early line of ESP-12H modules has a labelling error. IO28 is supposed to be IO29. The image above is the correct pinout.

## Running

ESP32's are power hungry on boot and the USB to serial adapter might not be able to provide enough power for that. Use a stable 3.3v power supply that can supply more than 500 mA.
