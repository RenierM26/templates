Serial flashing the device with [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer)

[pinout](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s)

Carefully solder wires to ESP8266 chip and connect to appropriate pins on USB-to-TTL converter:

| __USB-to-TTL__ | __TYWES3__                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GND       | GND     |
| +3.3V     | 3v3 |
| TX        | RX       |
| RX        | TX       |

Do not use 5V! It will damage the chip.
