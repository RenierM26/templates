Custom fimware need. Cause: Colors inversed and weak white light.
Modification of the SM2135 driver (xlgt_04_sm2135.ino):

  const uint8_t SM2135_CURRENT = (SM2135_20MA << 4) | SM2135_60MA;  //increased white to 60mA (19W)
  
  data[0] = SM2135_ADDR_MC;
  data[1] = SM2135_CURRENT;
  data[2] = SM2135_RGB;
  data[3] = cur_col[2];  // change that
  data[4] = cur_col[1];  // change that
  data[5] = cur_col[0];  // change that
  Sm2135Send(data, 6);
