This dimmer switch is manufactured by Earda Technologies and sold under many brands such Girier, Lonsonho, Moes, Tessan, white label and more.

## Serial Flash
Unit contains a WB3S tuya chip.  I transplanted an ESP12F module in it's place pre-flashed with tasmota via serial flash.  If you use ESP-12F/E module, you must ground GPIO15 with a piece of wire or solder or the switch won't power on.
