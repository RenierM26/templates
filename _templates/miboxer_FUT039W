## Hardware

![MiBoxer FUT039W RGB+CCT LED Controller (WIFI+2.4G) Board](/assets/device_images/miboxer_FUT039W_pcb.webp)

The chip used on this board is a WBR3, and requires a transplant. It cannot be flashed. The daughterboard for the SoC is compatible with the ESP12-S. Other formats may be compatible, but may require jumper wires.

The TuyaMCU on board requires the following settings for an RGB+CCT strip.

```console
Backlog DimmerRange 0,1000; TuyaMCU 11,20; TuyaMCU 26,21; TuyaMCU 21,22; TuyaMCU 23,23; TuyaMCU 24,24;
```

## Serial Flashing

Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#hardware-preparation) page for general instructions.
