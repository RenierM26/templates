Like Hama 4AC 4USB powerstrip (00176574), but LedLink_i. Added 'webbutton5 USB' (as there) and 'Rule1 ON button1#state=3 DO Power0 2 ENDON' to toggle all outlets together with a long buttonpress. 'so32 20' sets that to 2 seconds and 'Rule1 1' activates it. Powerstrips don't have 16 timers each outlet, but for all outlets. So they are somewhat limited and you may have to use rules.

I've found it more easy to unsolder the TYWE2S instead of the USB relay.
