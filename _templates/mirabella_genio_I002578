I found only 5 relays in my board, 1 foreach plug, and one for the 2 usb outputs.
template:{"NAME":"Genio Powerboa","GPIO":[56,0,0,0,22,21,0,0,24,17,25,23,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}

The outlets set to  relay 2 to 5, and the usb to relay 1.
with
```console
rule1 on button1#state=2 do backlog power5 2; power4 2; power3 2; power2 2 endon
ledmask 0x1e
```
A short press toggle all the outlets.  A double press toggles the usb.
The large led outside the button only lights if any of the outputs have power, not  the usb.
Every outlet has is only led, which just  track the state of the outlet, no control. The usb also has and led, but it is hard to see. just a background blue glow that cab be seen if nothing is plugged in.
