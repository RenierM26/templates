Once the template is applied, run the following commands to configure communication with the MCU:
```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 21,2; DimmerRange 0,1000
```

I found that the lights started to flicker when the brightness was below about 20%, to prevent this, I have the following rule (adjust the 20 below to what works for your setup):
```console
rule1 ON Dimmer#State<20 DO Dimmer 20 ENDON
```
