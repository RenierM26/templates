All three gang models are equivalent to the Sonoff T1 xCH models
and all three gang types have 3 physical buttons in them, just configured by resistors on the daughter board, plus all 3 gang types have all the relay driver circuity in them, just only fitted with the equivalent gang amount of relays.
The older -A3 model has the easy access PSF-B04 ESP board in them, the newer -B3 models what appears to be a custom ESP board in them (label of SM-001 v1 see photo) which is much harder to get access, best method is to remove front switch daughter board..
