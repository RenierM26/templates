A Feather form-factor ESP32-S2 dev board with an IPS ST7789V 1.14" display with 240x135 resolution.

This board uses an [`ESP32-S2-MINI-1-N4R2`](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2-mini-1_esp32-s2-mini-1u_datasheet_en.pdf) module with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM.

When the board is booted into debug by holding `BOOT` and pressing the `RESET` button the USB port exposes a serial connection. This can be used to easily flash new firmware.

### Peripherals

#### ST7789 TFT Display

The display works as expected with the `tasmota32s2-display.bin` firmware. These commands will help set up the display.

```
DisplayModel 15
DisplayWidth 240
DisplayHeight 135
DisplayRotate 3
```

This template sets up the display backlight as _"Toggle 2"_.

The board uses `GPIO21` for power to the display so this template sets that pin to _"Output Hi"_ to make sure that the display is powered on.

#### WS2818 Neopixel

This template sets up the WS2818 LED as a light, with _"Toggle 1"_ controlling the LED's power state.

The board uses `GPIO34` for power to the LED so the template sets that to "Output Hi" so that the LED works.

#### LiPo Charging/Monitoring

This board has a 2-pin JST-PH battery connector and a LIPO charging circuit built in. This circuit uses an MCP73831 fpr automatic charge/discharge management and a [LC709203](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/lc709204f-d.pdf) battery monitor on the I2C bus.

Although LC709203 isn't supported by Tasmota this board works fine with Tasmota running on battery power.

#### BMEx80 (unpopulated)

Its possible to add a BMEx80 (BME280 or BME680) by manually soldering one onto available pads on the bottom of the board, but this isn't included from the factory.

As long as `GPIO21` is high (powering on the display and I2C bus) this should work fine with Tasmota if the chip is soldered on.

#### [STEMMA-QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/technical-specs) / [QWIIC](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) Connector

A 4-pin JST-SH socket on the board allows for quick attachment of I2C sensors and other devices. This board uses 3.3v logic so this connector is compatible with QWIIC as well.

#### Debug Console Output

The bottom-right corner pin, labeled `DBG`, is attached to the ESP32-S2's debug serial output. It isn't useful within Tasmota but can be helpful for development, troubleshooting, or data logging.
