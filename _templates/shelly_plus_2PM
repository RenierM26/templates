Pin-Layout on the image is for shelly plus 1PM, credit goes to Kalin Dimitrov.
The pin ports on this board can handle dupont cables if done carefully, and will probably crumble shortly thereafter. 
The other surface connectors seem unusually weakly connected to the PCB, and you may destroy them while using them.

The ADC-parameters are not known yet, only guesses. They seem to be different to the Shelly 2.5 and other Shelly devices that are ESP8266.
